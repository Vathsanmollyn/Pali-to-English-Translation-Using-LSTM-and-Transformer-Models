# Pali-to-English Translation using Transformers

## Overview
This project focuses on translating Pali text into English using Transformer-based deep learning models. The dataset is processed, trained, and evaluated to improve translation accuracy.

## Features
- Implementation of Transformer-based models
- Preprocessing of Pali text
- Training and evaluation on custom datasets
- Model performance visualization

## Installation & Setup
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If a `requirements.txt` file is not available, install necessary libraries manually:

```bash
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training is a collection of Pali-English translations.
- It is available in the `output_file.csv` file.

## Usage
### Running the Model
Execute the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `Final_Transformer.ipynb` and run all cells.

Alternatively, run the script (if applicable):
```bash
python train_model.py
```
